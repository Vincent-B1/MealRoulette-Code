1. JSON Structure and Consistency

Valid JSON format: Check Correctly structured — no missing commas or brackets.
Field consistency: Each Meal object includes consistent fields:
Name, Groups, Status, Visible, PrepTime, CookTime, Ingredients, CustomFilters.

Optional improvement:
Ensure uniform capitalization in ingredients ("FLour" → "Flour"; "Potatos" → "Potatoes", "Rasins" → "Raisins", "Chedder" → "Cheddar").
Consistent phrasing for "Salt And Pepper" → "Salt", "Pepper".

Readability: Good indentation and clarity — easy for parsing by your program.

2. Data Quality and Logic

Each meal’s PrepTime + CookTime are realistic values (no negative or missing).
CustomFilters are logically categorized (Snack, Dessert, Dinner, etc.).
Status and Visible flags provide control for filtering and GUI visibility — well implemented.

3. Schema Design Fit
If integrated with your Meal Roulette classes, the data aligns well:
Meal.Name → unique identifier (good for random selection or search).
Meal.CustomFilters → supports whitelist/blacklist filtering.
Meal.Visible → GUI toggling logic ready for integration.

4. Potential Enhancements

Add Meal.Type field or reuse CustomFilters to group by course (e.g., "MealType": "Dinner").
Add "Origin" (e.g., Dutch, American) for cultural filtering.
Include "Servings" or "Difficulty" for future expansion.
Consider normalizing "Groups" to link with User preferences or events.

Integration Testing Plan (Merge + End-to-End)
1. Pre-Merge Validation
Branch comparison: Ensure no duplicate or renamed attributes between branches (Meal.Type vs CustomFilters).
Unit tests:
test_load_json() – verifies JSON deserializes into Meal objects without exceptions.
test_meal_visibility() – checks hidden meals don’t appear in roulette results.
test_filter_logic() – confirm whitelist/blacklist correctly filter CustomFilters.

2. Merge & Run

Merge the feature-json-meals branch into dev or main.
Resolve conflicts — especially in meal_class.py, load_data.py, or filters.py.
Re-run existing test suite (pytest or equivalent).


3. End-to-End Verification
Simulate:

Load JSON → confirm meals appear in GUI or CLI list.
Spin function → returns only "Status": "Active" and "Visible": true meals.
Apply filters → confirm "Quick" or "Dessert" restricts results accordingly.
User selection persistence → verify selected meal stores correctly.

4. Regression Check
No loss of functionality from prior MVP version.
Confirm no duplicate meal names in loaded data.
If DB integration exists, ensure JSON imports don’t break schema constraints.
