About Meal Roulette:<br>
Meal roulette is an app designed to help users select a random meal from a selection. <br>
Users can use filters to narrow down this selection, by using custom user-tags such as [quick] or [grill]. Users can also organize meals into groups.<br>
~~Both individual meals and groups can be given override status of being "lock"ed into the selection or "freeze" out of the selection.<br>~~
Currently only individual meals can have the "freeze" status as an individual override to be filtered out of the selection<br>
